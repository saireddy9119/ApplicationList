# Getting Started with Create React App

*Before Starting the application run this command in the terminal : npm i
*To Start a project: use npm run start.

*For Google Auth Login I use google auth npm packages and jwt-decode.

*After Login,We redirected to home page.

*In home page,you will find application list with search functionality.

*The details of application list is fetched using backend api endpoint name api/applications.

*To run backend nodejs application run :npm run start.

*In backend project, I use Express,Nodemon,MongoDB,Mongooose.

*In backend project implementation I used file structure like routes,controllers and Models.

*The applications api response is array of objects.

*The application in the home page is clickable.

*When user clicks on application it redirects into application page screen.

*In application page,It shows application name and id of the application.

*If duplicate tab of application page is open,It shows a pop you are already open this application.

*If click on logout in popup or alert,It redirects the Login page into home page.If you select cancel the existing page goes into the Login Page.

*For Implementation of detecting duplicate tabs, we store information in localStorage.
